# 🍓 Fruit Sales Dashboard — Business Insights with No Timestamp Needed

## 📁 Overview
This Power BI dashboard breaks down fruit sales across countries and categories, spotlighting performance even without time-based data. By focusing on price, product type, and geographic sales distribution, I created actionable insights for inventory planning and promotional strategy—no timestamps required.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Excel**: initial data cleanup and sanity checks
- **UX-aware design**: slicers, tooltips, and intuitive layout for smoother user flow

## 🎯 Questions I Explored
- Which fruits bring in the highest revenue?
- What countries generate the most revenue from fruit sales?
- Where are our sales happening, and how much are we making per region?

## 💡 Insight Highlights
